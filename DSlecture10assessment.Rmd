In the PULSE data, the primary outcome is BDI score; itâ€™s observed over follow-up visits, and we might ask if the typical BDI score values are roughly similar at each. Try to write a code chunk that imports, cleans, and summarizes the PULSE data to examine the mean and median at each visit. Export the results of this in a reader-friendly format.

pulse_df =
  read_sas("./data/public_pulse_data.sas7bdat") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%

  )

In the FAS data, there are several outcomes of interest; for now, focus on post-natal day on which a pup is able to pivot. Two predictors of interest are the dose level and the day of treatment. Produce a reader-friendly table that quantifies the possible associations between dose, day of treatment, and the ability to pivot.

```{r}
pup_data = 
  read_csv("./data/FAS_pups.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(sex = recode(sex, `1` = "male", `2` = "female")) 

litter_data = 
  read_csv("./data/FAS_litters.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(group, into = c("dose", "day_of_tx"), sep = 3)

fas_data = left_join(pup_data, litter_data, by = "litter_number") 

fas_data %>% 
  group_by(dose, day_of_tx) %>%
  drop_na(dose) %>% 
  summarize(mean_pivot = mean(pd_pivot, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = dose,
    values_from = mean_pivot
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
  
```
